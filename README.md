# Congenial Telegram
a collection of print publishing resources

# Where did the name come from?
It was the random suggestion from GitHub and too perfect to resist.

# Can I use these templates?
That's what they're here for. I want to make publishing easy for everyone.

# Will you make ___ ?
Maybe. I make the tools I need. But you can ask.

# What else do you do? 
Congenial Telegram is also a (monthly) zine! Download a printable PDF in the Archives folder. And, of course, I have a blog: http://jessdriscoll.com/blog/

# How can I support Congenial Telegram?
I have zines for sale on Etsy: https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/jessdriscoll or Itch.io: http://jessdriscoll.itch.io. You can also donate once or monthly: https://ko-fi.com/jessdriscoll
